# Data Preparation

## Overview

Contains scripts for preparing the data in JSON format to be indexed. This includes data extraction, transformation, and cleaning processes.

## Steps Involved

- **Extraction**: Extracting relevant data from the raw data collected by the Scanner.
- **Transformation**: Transforming the data to match the desired JSON structure.
- **Cleaning**: Cleaning the data and substituting any missing fields or handling mismatched data types.

## USAGE
- **Coming soon**

## NOTE

- Please use `requirements_temp.txt` for now.


## TODO

- `data_preparation/data_preparation.py`: Remove `Pandas` dependency - should be doable with simple csv_reader. 
- Remove `myenv` from `.gitignore` - too specific for one user (Tanmay Agrawal)
